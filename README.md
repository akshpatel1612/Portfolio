# Aksh Patel Portfolio (Animated Version)

This folder contains a polished, animated single‑page portfolio for Aksh Patel. It features a modern dark theme with golden accents, a hero section with a background image, and separate sections for About, Experience, Education, Projects, Publications, Skills and Contact.

## Structure

- **index.html** – the main HTML file.
- **style.css** – the accompanying stylesheet including animations and responsive styles.
- **assets/** – images and downloadable files used in the site:
  - `hero.png` – hero background image.
  - `project1.png`–`project4.png` – placeholder images for the project cards. Replace these with your own project screenshots.
  - `thesis.pdf` – placeholder PDF for your thesis. Replace this file with your actual thesis document.

## Customization

1. **Images:**
   - To use your own project images, upload them to the `assets/` folder and update the `<img src="assets/projectX.png" />` paths in `index.html`.
   - To replace the hero background, add your new image to `assets/` and edit the `.hero` background definition in `style.css`.

2. **Text and Links:**
   - Edit any section in `index.html` to update descriptions, job roles, dates, or project details.
   - Update the `href` attributes to link to your actual documents, PPTs or external dashboards.

3. **Form:**
   - The contact form uses [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) to send messages to your email. Replace the email in the `action` attribute if needed.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Push the contents of this folder to a GitHub repository.
   - Enable GitHub Pages on the repository to host the site. See the project’s previous instructions for configuring your custom domain.
